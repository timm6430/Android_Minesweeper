# Android_Minesweeper

For this school project I created a minsweeper app that works in Andriod Studio. 
With an Object-oriented programming design, I used Java for the game logic and andriod studio to create the interactive board. 

It plays like normal minesweeper except you can't flag bombs and there's no score system.
